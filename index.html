<h1>Calvin, The Collector</h1>
<div class="row">

        <div class="container">
            <p>While wandering through the mountains you stumble across a cave. With your curiosity piqued, you step inside and to your surprise you finds tons of gold, gems, and treasure!</p>
            <p>Before you you can grab any of it though, a dragon appears from the dark corners of the cave, and speaks to you.</p>
            <p>"Hello, human. My name is Calvin and I see you have found my treasure. I do not often have visitors, so I won't eat you... yet. My kind enjoy riddles and games. Would you care to play a round or two?"</p>
            <p>You agree, because, well, it's a dragon and you'd rather not upset him.</p>
            <p>"Wonderful. My game works like this. I will choose a random number. In front of you are 4 magic gems each with an assigned but unknown numeric value. You must choose your gems until the your number is equal to my number. If you match it, you will win. Go over and you will lose. We can play as many times as you like, but each time the gems will have new numbers."</p>
            <p>Calvin has already selected his number. Start by clicking on a gem and observe your number as it increase with each click, trying to match Calvin's.</p>
